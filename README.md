# Chromosome Scale Rice Genome Assembly and Annotation
Undergraduate thesis project for Final-Year-Project as Information System Student: chromosome scale rice genome assembly and annotation pipeline.

## Introduction
PR25 is a perennial hybrid rice derived from RD23 and the wild progenitor Oryza longistaminata.
This work performs genome based computational analyses covering assembly QC, annotation transfer, orthology inference, functional annotation, and result integration to map PR25 gene origin and dominant functional signals.
Scope excludes variant calling, gene expression analysis, and wet lab validation.

## Objectives
1. Classify PR25 genes into RD23_only, OL_only, and BOTH using ortholog evidence against RD23 and O. longistaminata.
2. Compare functional annotation coverage (KNOWN vs UNKNOWN) across origin groups.
3. Summarize dominant functions among KNOWN genes by integrating orthology based (eggNOG mapper) and protein signature based (InterProScan) evidence.
